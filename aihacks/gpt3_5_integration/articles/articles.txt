Republican poll-watcher planning raises prospects of noncitizen voting
North Carolina election officials air concerns about potential voter and poll worker intimidation
Voting rights advocates say effort is aimed at creating doubt in the event of a Kamala Harris victory
SANFORD, North Carolina, Oct 24 (Reuters) - "Be aggressive," Jim Womack, a local Republican Party chair in North Carolina, told the grid of faces who joined the Zoom training session for volunteers to monitor voting on Nov. 5. "The more assertive and aggressive you are in watching and reporting, the better the quality of the election."
During the two-hour session, conducted from a Republican Party office featuring a placard of an AR-15 rifle and photos of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Womack, 69, an army veteran and a retired information systems engineer, instructed 40 volunteers on how to spot "nefarious activity." He mentioned a local clergyman who accompanied dozens of Latino parishioners to a voting site "like a shepherd leading a sheep."

Voter fraud is exceedingly rare in the United States - despite Trump's false claim, supported by a majority of Republicans in Congress, that the 2020 election was stolen.
U.S. election security officials have said the 2020 election was “the most secure in American history.” A months-long analysis by the Associated Press found fewer than 475 cases of potential voter fraud in the six battleground states challenged by Trump.
With less than two weeks to go until the Nov. 5 election, officials in Lee County in the battleground state of North Carolina told Reuters they are concerned that training sessions like Womack's, with its call for aggressive scrutiny of the voting process, could lead to disruptions at the polls. The Lee County officials say they are adopting new safeguards to prevent poll workers from feeling intimidated.

Womack said that election officials should welcome his North Carolina Election Integrity Team as additional eyes and ears to ensure a fair election. NCEIT has close links to the Republican Party.
Reuters observed an Oct. 16 NCEIT training session and obtained previously unreported transcripts of NCEIT planning calls, which raised the prospect of noncitizen voting.
Reuters also spoke to 10 election officials, former election officials and voter rights advocates who expressed concerns that some poll watchers could disrupt, delay and undermine confidence in the election, and potentially lay the groundwork to overturn the result if Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris wins.
"The playbook seems to be to cast doubt, sow chaos at every possible opportunity, so that if you lose you then have laid the foundation in the minds of your followers and supporters to justify additional action," said Tammy Patrick, a former election official who now works at the National Association of Election Administrators, a nonpartisan group of state election directors.

HOW TO SPOT AN 'ILLEGAL'
Poll watchers, who monitor the casting and counting of ballots at polling stations, have been a feature of the American electoral system for decades.
The Democratic Party plans to field its own observers at polling places, including those in Lee County. The Democratic National Committee and the Harris campaign said they are mobilizing thousands of volunteers in voter protection teams across key states, but declined to give further details.
Despite its extreme rarity, Trump and his fellow Republicans have made allegations of noncitizen voting a key part of preparations for legal challenges if Trump loses on Nov. 5.
"Non citizen Illegal Migrants are getting the right to vote, being pushed by crooked Democrat Politicians," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform in July.
NCEIT addressed noncitizen voting in two planning calls, according to the transcripts obtained by Reuters. In July, a participant raised the subject of how to spot an "illegal" and suggested that a person who can't speak English probably doesn't have the right to vote.
One participant in an NCEIT planning call in May said she makes signs for polling locations in different languages, including in "African," stating only U.S. citizens can vote. She called her signs "psyop," shorthand for psychological operations aimed at influencing people's behavior.
Womack said that he doesn't recall that conversation and does not agree with the assertion. "These live calls are conversations and we get lots of inquiries," he said. He added that NCEIT strives to educate and train participants in accordance with the law, and sometimes has to correct invalid statements and assertions on the calls.
But he said that NCEIT's “antenna are up about the influx of Hispanics, and they're accidentally being registered to vote.”
Patrick Gannon, public information director for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said there was no evidence of noncitizens trying to affect the election in any way.
NCEIT would challenge any voter it believed was ineligible, Womack said. He also told trainees to be polite and said that NCEIT does not "condone voter suppression or intimidation of any kind."

Some voter rights advocates said the training could lead to unfair targeting of Black or Latino voters.
"We're concerned that rhetoric about noncitizens voting will be used to say there was some sort of irregularity and try to prevent the election results from being certified," said Katelin Kaiser, policy director at watchdog group Democracy North Carolina.
WATCHING THE WATCHERS
Womack does not accept the evidence that election fraud is very rare. While he said he does not use the word "stolen" to describe the 2020 election won by Democrat Joe Biden, he insists the election was "manipulated by Big Tech, Big Government, and Big Media."
“The vast majority of the operations seeking to shape the election, or I should say, not shape, to exploit vulnerabilities in the law and to commit fraud in the election are coming from the left,” Womack told Reuters in an interview. “There's no doubt about it,” he added.
NCEIT is affiliated to the Election Integrity Network, an organization run by Cleta Mitchell, an attorney who played a key role in trying to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss. In 2020, Mitchell was on the call when Trump asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to find enough votes to reverse Biden's victory in the state.
Christina Norton, the director of the Republican Party’s election integrity unit, joins a weekly Friday morning call hosted by Mitchell’s EIN group, according to Womack, who also attends.
Mitchell and Norton did not respond to Reuters when asked for comment.
The Republican National Committee says it has trained tens of thousands of volunteer poll watchers, instructing them to call an RNC hotline to report suspected irregularities. RNC poll watchers who do not act within the law will be dismissed, the party says on its website.
An official familiar with the operations of the RNC's Election Integrity Unit, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the RNC has no relationship with groups such as NCEIT that train poll watchers. The official said RNC poll watcher efforts are independent from those groups.
BLURRED LINES
In Lee County, which Trump won comfortably in 2020 and 2016, the lines are blurred. Womack is himself the Republican Party chair. He said NCEIT sends its list of poll watchers to both parties for possible inclusion in their efforts.
"To me, it seems like they're trying to gather data that they could put together to then create doubt in the election," said Lee County Elections board Chairwoman Susan Feindel, a Democrat. "All I want is to have a free and fair election and to be left alone so that we can do our jobs."
Lee County election officials say they have taken precautions to guard against what they see as overly aggressive behavior by some poll observers who have been trained by NCEIT.
After state legislation last year allowed observers to move more freely around polling stations, Lee County officials said they ordered curtains for the booths. They also purchased screen protectors to cover voting machines and privacy sleeves to cover ballots.
In the 2022 midterm congressional elections, the North Carolina election board registered 21 incidents regarding poll watchers, including 12 of voter intimidation, eight of election official intimidation and one of voter interference. Their records do not specify who trained those poll watchers.
In the primaries earlier that year, Womack followed an election worker who was transporting ballot boxes to the board of elections office, according to an incident report reviewed by Reuters.
Womack was not charged with wrongdoing. He told Reuters he had wanted to ensure that the ballots were delivered safely to the board of elections office. He does not view his actions as intimidation.
Since then, Lee County Elections Director Jane Rae Fawcett has asked local police to be on stand-by at the end of polling, in case election officials need additional security as they transport ballots.
The concerns about overly aggressive poll watchers are not limited to North Carolina.
"My main concern is voter intimidation by poll watchers, as well as intimidating election workers and getting into their faces, generally slowing them down and creating disruptions," said Andrew Garber, a lawyer and elections expert with New York University's non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice.

For more than 20 years, Steven Hines, has worked in election administration in North Carolina. He served as an elections director in five counties — Pitt, Forsyth, Greene, Carteret counties and most recently, Lenoir County, where he resigned in August 2023.  

“The pay for elections directors is not equitable to what they’re having to do,” Hines said. “A reliable person may step out and do something else because they’re tired of having to deal with animosity and the issues to say, ‘Well, heck, I can get paid to be the nighttime manager at my local 7-Eleven.’”

In addition to pay disparity, the treatment and scrutiny of elections directors by some counties, politicians and the public contributes to high turnover among elections directors in North Carolina, according to Hines. 

“Who are you going to get to replace them that’s trustworthy enough and can have the knowledge, experience and the ethics to do the job fairly?”

While other states have had similar problems, North Carolina has seen a steep recent uptick in its loss of experienced county elections directors, which has led to concerns from state officials.

During the virtual state canvass meeting for the 2024 primary in March, Karen Brinson Bell, the N.C. State Board of Elections’ executive director, who also serves as the vice president of the National Association of State Election Directors, raised concerns about the high turnover among North Carolina county elections directors and the loss of “institutional knowledge” in election administration.  

Since January, 10 N.C. counties have lost elections directors. Three county board of elections directors resigned, one left the role for a position with another county department and five retired, so far, with a sixth retiring by the end of the year, according to data CPP received from the state board. 

“This continues to be an ongoing problem,” said Brinson Bell of the departures. 

In the past five years, the 100 counties in the state have changed elections directors 61 times, according to the state board. Since 2019, 38 directors retired, 21 resigned, one died and one was terminated.

Of those who left their roles as directors, just four took a position with another county board of elections. Four took a position with the state board, two took a position in another county department and one took an elections position in another state. 

One county, Wilson, has yet to fill its vacant position, according to the state board. Duplin County is in the final stages of finalizing a candidate to fill the position there. Dare County will also have a new director, but hasn’t yet posted the job, as the current director is retiring on July1, according to the state board’s public information director, Patrick Gannon. 

“As a state agency, we’re charged with oversight of all 100 counties and what I’m flagging is that the turnover has a trickle-down effect to other demands on resources and services that we need to provide in order to ensure that we’re able to carry out elections for every North Carolinian to cast their ballot,” Brinson Bell said.

This article is the first in the three-part investigative series Elections Brain Drain from Carolina Public Press, examining how pay disparities and working conditions for North Carolina county elections directors are leading to high turnover, resulting in a loss of experienced and knowledgeable people willing to do this job, which is essential in keeping the state’s democratic system working properly. 

Later articles in the series will also examine the systemic problems that affect what counties can afford to pay in order to recruit and retain elections directors and possible solutions to these issues.

In order to understand the dynamics of county elections director pay and tenure on the job across the state, CPP issued public records requests to all 100 counties over a two-month period in spring 2024.

A total of 68 counties, just over two thirds of the state, provided responses, though a few counties only responded in part. Despite multiple emails and calls, the other 32 counties did not comply with CPP’s request in time to be included in this report. 

NC Elections Director pay disparity
“I think perhaps if the pay were better, you would entice candidates to come and actually stay,” said Sara Lavere, president of the North Carolina Association of Directors of Elections and elections director in Brunswick County. 

“If you get someone making a pretty decent salary where they can live comfortably, they’re going to think twice about running for the hills when things get tough.”

Salaries in the counties that provided data to CPP, vary anywhere from an hourly wage in one, at $19.28-an-hour for an unspecified number of hours, to up to about $200,000 a year. In addition to the pay disparity that exists among county elections directors, many described increased responsibilities, high pressure and dealing with incidents of harassment while on the job. 

In North Carolina, the salary for elections directors must be comparable to what counties that are similar in size, population and the number of registered voters are paying their directors, according to state statute. The state also sets a minimum for pay in the statute, requiring counties to pay directors an hourly wage of at least $12 along with benefits. Legislators last adjusted that pay level in 1999.

An elections director’s skills weren’t viewed as part of a specialized skill set before, the way they are today, according to Christopher Cooper, a professor of political science and public affairs at Western Carolina University. 

“It’s a more complicated job than it used to be,” Cooper said. “I don’t think their pay is reflective of the increasing responsibility they have.”

Some elections directors are highly experienced and have worked in election administration for years. Among those who provided data to CPP, five have served more than 20 years. But the median tenure of an elections director among responding counties was just 5 years, with 20 having served less than half of the median. 

Based on that data the median yearly salary for county elections directors is $68,750, which is what Rowan County pays its director. While a few counties paid more than twice that level, many paid much less. 

In 12 of the counties that provided data, elections directors made less than 75% of the median, or under about $51,000 a year, including in Hyde, Graham, Madison, Perquimans, Chowan, Washington, Vance, Alleghany, Anson, Greene, Swain and Richmond counties.

The lowest yearly salary for an elections director, based on the data CPP received from counties, is $40,186 in Graham County. But the lowest pay for elections directors in the state, overall, is the $19.28 hourly wage for the part-time director in Hyde County, which is also the only county that pays an hourly wage for the position. 

“Personally, I work two jobs so the part-time schedule doesn’t bother me as much,” said Viola Williams, the elections director in Hyde County, but “because of the demands of this job, I really think it needs to be a full-time job.”

Both Graham and Hyde counties are some of the least-populated counties in the state, a deciding factor in the pay for elections directors, according to state law. 

“When you look at how department heads in county administration are paid or their pay scale, the elections department heads tend to be on the lower tier,” Lavere said.

In Alexander County, for instance, Elections Director Patrick Wike is one of the least-paid department heads in his county. The next lowest, the library director, earns almost $3,000 more than the elections director. Salaries for department heads range from 173,939 for the county manager to $42,410 for the senior center director. 

“The county elections director is one of the lowest-classed department heads in Alexander County,” said Wike, who earns $55,643. 

The highest paid of those provided data is Wake County, where the elections director earns a yearly salary of $197,852.

Seven counties for which CPP received data, including Wake, Buncombe, Cabarrus, Forsyth, Gaston, Johnston and Mecklenburg counties, pay elections directors more than $100,000 a year.

Elections directors in 13 counties that provided data received neither a raise nor a cost of living increase this year. 

Even among raises and salary adjustments for elections directors a disparity persists. In most counties where directors received an increase, it was typically a cost-of-living adjustment, though some directors received merit raises.

While the median raise or adjustment this past year was $3,000, CPP found that these increases varied from $100 to more than $30,000 among the counties. In Gaston County, the elections director earns $123,600 and received a $138.47 raise this year.

Whereas, in Cabarrus County, the elections director earns $116,584 and received a $33,550 increase, but this included a cost-of-living adjustment, performance raise and grade change. 

Directors in 14 counties told CPP they are not expecting a raise or a salary adjustment this year. 

How elections director pay correlates to turnover
CPP analyzed data from the counties that responded to its records request and found a strong, if indirect, correlation between pay levels and turnover.

The counties that paid the least or paid the least in relation to their population, tended to have elections directors in place for the least amount of time. Counties with the highest pay levels, especially in relation to their populations, tended to have the highest-tenured directors.

Exceptions to these trends are also easy to find, which shouldn’t be surprising. Many factors affect tenure, including retirements, firings and deaths of previous directors who may not have voluntarily left their positions. And even when a director does decide to leave, many factors besides pay are likely to play some role.

Still, the overall finding was strong. For instance, in 20 counties in which directors have been in place 2.5 years or less, 65% of them paid the median level or below. While 35% of the high-tenure counties paid above the median level, only 5% of the low tenure counties paid as much as 25% above the median or more.

The same trend holds on the opposite end of the spectrum. CPP identified 20 counties that had directors on the job 11 years or more, which is at least twice the median tenure for counties that provided data. Of those, 60% paid above the median level, with 35% of these counties paying 25% above the median. Only 40% of these high-tenure counties pay below the median level, with just 15% that paid less than 75% of the median.

Directing elections for an entire county is a big job, but generally the job involves greater responsibilities proportional to the population of the county. Cost of living is also typically higher for more populous counties. For that reason, CPP also examined pay level for elections directors in relation to population. While this didn’t correlate as closely to tenure, generally counties with the lowest tenure paid poorly per capita and counties with the highest tenure paid well per capita.

If a director decides to leave a county because of the pay level, it could be simply because the director simply wants to make more money. But it could also be because the director believes the job is not paying enough for the size of the county, which is a factor the statute says counties should consider when setting pay levels. 

CPP evaluated both of these factors together and found an overall pattern of counties that had both higher pay and higher pay per capita being more likely to retain directors for longer and those with lower pay and lower pay per capita being more likely to have more recently replaced their directors.

Working conditions
In addition to requesting public records on salaries and tenure, CPP asked North Carolina counties about working conditions. 

A few of the counties that provided other information didn’t address working conditions, but overall most respondents, 32, described positive working conditions at their county boards of elections. These counties often said they had a favorable relationship with county management to help facilitate adequate resources and funding of their election boards, since directors depend on county commissioners for this.

However eight counties, Alexander, Carteret, Caswell, Chatham , Hyde, Iredell, Pasquotank and Swain, described working conditions as being demanding or fast-paced.

Workload is heavy year round, according to Elections Director Wike in Alexander County. 

“Most people don’t understand all the logistics and yearlong preparations in order to have accurate and efficient elections,” Wike said. 

Since 2020, elections work has become very demanding and stressful, according to Robert Webb, the elections director in Caswell County. Webb holds the only full-time position on his county’s election board.

 “A lot of long hours, frustration and at times you do get to a point that it feels like there is no way you can do it all, but someone has to do this work,” he said. 

Pandora Paschal, the elections director in Chatham County, said that while working conditions are hectic, it is the nature of the job. But, the job has “become more hectic because of legislative law changes that require more work administratively and the political climate has changed drastically,” Paschal said. 

Two counties, Randolph and Polk counties, negatively described their working conditions. 

“We love what we do, but the temperament of voters and campaigners is more negative since the 2020 presidential election,” said Melissa Kirstner, the elections director in Randolph County. “It is a more tense, negative environment for staff and precinct workers” Kirstner has worked in her role for more than 13 years. 

“We get one chance to do it right and cannot afford any mistakes in an ever-changing and unforgiving environment,” said Cliff Marr, the elections director in Polk County. Marr described working conditions as very stressful.  

In another group of eight counties, directors described having limited office space. Those included Chowan, Halifax, Hoke, Macon, Person, Stanly, Watauga and Wilkes counties.

Incidents of harassment  
While some counties reported increased instances of harassment, 49 counties reported none. But this doesn’t mean incidents did or did not take place, only that they didn’t report any issues to CPP.

In Haywood County, Robert Inman, the elections director, didn’t report any incidents, but said people from the public call and frequently leave voicemails. 

voter id

“It ranges from election denialism to criticizing a specific voting mechanism and people are often parroting what they have heard from the media,” Inman said. But, he added, “all of us in this profession consider safety and incidents of harassment a lot more now than in years past.”

Increased threats against elections directors may also be a reason why many are choosing to leave, said WCU political scientist Cooper. 

“I think it’s … a more politicized job than it was and it’s a harder and more dangerous job than it was before,” he said. “I think it makes sense to me that people are dropping out.”

Nine counties reported incidents to CPP — Ashe, Carteret, Caswell, Durham, Halifax, Iredell, McDowell, Onslow and Randolph counties. Only one county reported an incident that escalated physically and resulted in a police report. 

Kim Welborn, the elections director in McDowell County, said a poll observer who wasn’t complying with the rules threatened her. 

“I was threatened physically and hands were laid on me, a police report was made, but I chose not to file charges,” Welborn said. She said she’s worried about an increase in these incidents.

Ashe County, a small mountain county with only about 27,000 residents, reported 10 minor incidents, usually during voting and largely having to do with trust in the election process. 

“We do our best to educate, unfortunately once someone has made up their mind there’s not a lot you can do to change it,” said Devon Houck, Ashe County elections director. “I feel like most people are just venting their frustrations or are just misinformed about the process.”

In Carteret County, five to 10 incidents take place yearly, according to elections director Caitlin Sabadish. 

“Members of the public cuss us out for ‘election fraud, disinformation, and a lack of understanding of laws and procedures,’” Sabadish said. 

In Caswell County, Webb said he’s faced incidents of harassment both in person and electronically, but did not want to disclose specifics. 

“I have had someone threaten my position from a specific group,” Webb said. “I try to counter all hostility with kindness, honesty and proof that my words are tempered with the laws.” If things escalate and the individuals don’t leave freely, he gets help from a sheriff’s deputy along with some charges, he said. 

Derek Bowens in Durham County described an anonymous participant in a Zoom session calling Bowens, who is Black, an offensive racial term during the 2020 general election. But Bowens said he hasn’t experienced any harassment in person.

In Halifax County, Kristin Scott didn’t cite specific incidents but said they “usually occur as we get close to the election, more so countywide elections.”

Election officials in Iredell County deal with harassment from the same people and groups who frequently make accusations, Elections Director Susie Jordan said. 

While only some counties reported incidents and many did not, most of the counties with which CPP spoke discussed an increased awareness of the dangers that elections officials face and an increased concern for safety, especially during elections.

“The hostility, the expectation of perfection, in a very human driven process is just so great that their willingness to continue to make personal sacrifices to face hostility and harassment is just not enough to sustain the passion that they have for this profession,” said Brinson Bell, the executive director of the state board.

Sometimes harassment and pay levels can go hand in hand. 

In the past, election directors’ pay in some counties has been used to threaten them to meet demands that may be unrealistic or even illegal. 

Two years ago in Surry County, amid a growing presence of election deniers, people began questioning the results of the 2020 election that Michella Huff had administered. The chair of the Surry County Republican Party, William Keith Senter, led efforts to get the county commission to cut her pay and even to get her fired if she didn’t meet demands to let him access voting equipment. 

Senter messaged the commissioners, under the influence of election activists, to get her to cooperate or to cut her salary to $12 per hour, as per the law. 

Huff did not meet those demands.

Even though the State Board of Elections reported the threats against Huff to state, federal and local law enforcement, no one was ever charged.

News article about an increase of partisan poll observers happening in North Carolina and effects/concerns related to that

Feel like you're being watched? More partisan poll observers expected in North Carolina
The 2024 elections will likely feature more active partisan observers in polling places due to changes made by Republican state lawmakers last year.

More poll watchers in more places when you cast your vote in 2024
By Laura Leslie , WRAL capitol bureau chief



The 2024 elections are likely to feature an increased presence of partisan poll observers in North Carolina voting precincts due to new elections laws passed by Republican state lawmakers.

Under rules approved last year, the observers, who are appointed by political parties, will have greater freedom to move around in the voting enclosure than they previously had. There may be more of them at any given time. And they’ll also be able to come and go and be replaced by other observers more easily. The changes were included in Senate Bill 747, which was enacted in 2023 over Democratic Governor Roy Cooper’s veto.

Lawmakers said the changes were needed because under the previous rules, some chief judges only allowed observers a partial view of the enclosure. They also had to stay for long shifts, making those volunteer positions harder to staff.

The role of observers has grown in the wake of the 2020 election, when then-President Donald Trump made disproven claims of a stolen election. Polls show that conservative voters are particularly distrustful of elections following Trump’s claims. Elections officials say skepticism persists in North Carolina, even though Republican candidates won most major races in North Carolina in 2020.

Observers’ goal is to observe elections to ensure they’re being conducted fairly and by the book. And a smattering of new state elections laws — including the requirement for voters to present photo identification — will be under scrutiny this year.


Open in a new window
Critics of the bill say voters could feel intimidated by the observers, who aren’t required to receive any official training for the position. In 2022, elections officials in several counties reported problems with observers interfering with or harassing voters or poll workers.

The 2023 law made multiple charges to state election regulations. It’s the subject of a federal lawsuit challenging certain provisions that plaintiffs say are intended to hurt Democrats’ chances of winning future elections.The new rules for observers are not among the parts being challenged.

Under the new rules, poll observers will have to wear identifying badges so voters won’t confuse them with actual poll workers. They’re still not allowed to see who a voter is voting for, or to be close enough to see a ballot as the voter inserts it into the tabulator.


Observers are also not allowed to interfere or communicate with voters. And they’re not allowed to take photos or videos or make recordings inside the voting enclosure unless the chief judge and the voter grant them permission. The chief judge has the power to direct them to leave if they violate the rules.

Observers may also come close enough to listen to conversations between voters and poll workers.

“They are going to be listening for the check-in process,” State Elections Director Karen Brinson Bell told reporters this week. “They're going to be observing that a photo ID is presented. So they will overhear some conversation. But if it is a conversation that requires the disclosure of personal identifying information, for example, then they are restricted from being part of that conversation.”

She added that if voters have concerns at their early voting site, they should reach out to a poll worker. Voters can also contact their county boards of elections or the state board of elections to report any voting issues, she said.

“Hardworking poll workers of all political stripes will be at all early voting sites,” Bell said. “They are there to ensure your voting experience is smooth, and that all laws and rules are followed. They are there to make sure your vote counts.”

News article about North Carolina's racial gerrymandering allegations and subsequent lawsuits

North Carolina redistricting trial begins, with racial gerrymandering allegations the focus

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina congressional and legislative districts drawn by Republicans that helped them retain majorities in Raleigh and Washington are in court, as federal lawsuits accuse mapmakers of illegally eroding Black voting power in the process.

A three-judge panel convened Monday in Winston-Salem for a trial over allegations that GOP legislative leaders violated federal law and the U.S. Constitution when they enacted new electoral maps in the ninth-largest state in October 2023. Republican leaders counter that lawfully partisan — and not racial — considerations helped inform their decision-making.

The lines were used in the 2024 elections, after which Republicans kept General Assembly majorities and flipped three U.S. House seats held by Democratic incumbents who didn’t seek reelection because they decided the recast district made winning impossible. Those seat flips, which turned a 7-7 delegation into one with a 10-4 Republican advantage, helped the GOP keep narrow control of the House, which has helped advance President Donald Trump’s agenda.

Favorable rulings for the plaintiffs could force Republicans to redraw maps for the 2026 elections, making it harder to retain their partisan advantage. Otherwise, the districts could be used through the 2030 elections.

Who is suing and what they allege
The trial involves two lawsuits filed in late 2023.

In one lawsuit, the North Carolina NAACP, Common Cause and several Black residents originally sued over redrawn state House and Senate maps and U.S. House districts. The other lawsuit filed by nearly 20 Black and Latino voters focused on the new congressional districts, four of which they argue are illegal racial gerrymanders.


Pretrial rulings this spring and amended litigation dismissed challenges to the state House map and narrowed state Senate arguments to a handful of districts.

Still, both lawsuits claim that lines are so skewed for GOP candidates that many Black voters cannot elect their preferred candidates, violating the Voting Rights Act. They allege the mapmakers at times submerged or spread out Black voting blocs, which historically have favored Democrats, into surrounding districts with white majorities — benefiting Republicans.


They point to the Piedmont Triad region where the cities of Greensboro, High Point and Winston-Salem are located. They said Republicans split the region’s concentrated Black voting population within multiple U.S. House districts. Then-Rep. Kathy Manning, a Greensboro Democrat, decided not to run again because her district shifted to the right.

“This was an effort to spread those voters across districts,” said Jonathan Rodden, a Stanford University redistricting expert who testified Monday for some plaintiffs about congressional boundaries. Rodden said the results were less-compact districts that make it harder for voters within them to act collectively toward a common policy goal.

The plaintiffs also allege GOP lawmakers unlawfully packed Black voting-age residents into a Charlotte-area congressional district.


Republicans: Redistricting considered politics, not race
The trial’s lawyers agreed not to give opening statements Monday. But in a pretrial brief, lawyers for Republican leaders said the lawmakers used mapmaking rules that prohibited using data identifying the race of voters, in keeping with rulings on previous North Carolina redistricting maps in which judges chided them for emphasizing race.

Instead, Republicans were able to lawfully use partisan data — like statewide election results — in drawing the new maps, the lawyers said. They cite a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision and an April 2023 state Supreme Court decision that neutered legal claims of illegal partisan gerrymandering.

“The General Assembly has striven to end racial politics through race-blind redistricting,” wrote Katherine McKnight and Phil Strach, two lawyers for the GOP legislators, adding that a Voting Rights Act violation “would only return the State to the race-based redistricting it has sought to end.”

Rodden testified Monday the “racial sorting” of voters within challenged congressional districts that he examined can’t be attributed fully to politics alone. On cross-examination, Rodden acknowledged that he didn’t know all of the partisan factors that GOP lawmakers considered in 2023.


Who is hearing the case, and when will there be a ruling
The three judges were all nominated to the bench by Republican presidents: 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Allison Rushing (Donald Trump) and District Judges Thomas Schroeder (George W. Bush) and Richard Myers (Trump).

The panel has set aside several days for a trial that won’t end until July 9. Other likely witnesses include individual plaintiffs, state legislators, historians and more mapping experts. No immediate decision is expected — the legal sides have until early August to file additional briefs.

The court’s ruling can be appealed. With candidate filing for the 2026 election starting Dec. 1, any required remapping would have to be completed by late fall to avoid election disruptions.


Redistricting history
North Carolina has a long history of redistricting litigation in federal courts.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in landmark cases in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s involving racial bias and the extent to which racial considerations could be used in forming districts that favored the election of Black candidates. The court’s 2019 decision on partisan gerrymandering stemmed from a North Carolina case.

The current maps were drawn after the state Supreme Court, with a Republican seat majority, essentially struck down rulings the court made in 2022 when it had a Democratic majority.

Two other lawsuits challenging the 2023 district boundaries are pending.

Statewide races in North Carolina are close, and Democrats have held the governor’s mansion for most of the past 30 years. But Republicans have controlled the General Assembly — and thus redistricting — since 2011. Redistricting maps can’t be blocked by a governor’s veto.

We support our democracy when we adequately fund the administration of our elections
Free, fair, and safe elections are fundamental to the practice of our democracy. When we collectively fund our elections, we can make sure that all North Carolinians who are eligible to vote can participate without barriers and with confidence that their voices will be heard.

For too long, election administration has been underfunded. The result has been to depress voter turnout, reinforce barriers to the ballot box for Black, brown, and other people of color and people with disabilities, and undermine trust in the outcomes of elections. And while many have pointed to the critical role that early voting options, well-trained poll workers, and consistent voter education play in ensuring robust turnout and thus a more representative democracy, funding for election administration has been under scrutinized as the primary driver of whether those pathways to civic engagement are available in every community.

Underfunding election administration is another form of voter suppression that may not be intentional, but ultimately it leads to disparate experiences at the polls based on race and income, while it also reduces voter turnout and confidence.

Counties that spend more on elections can effectively boost the electoral voice and power of their residents. In North Carolina, where access to the ballot box for every person regardless of who they are or where they live has been under attack for more than a decade, the State Board of Election and the County Board of Elections in all 100 counties, which are primarily responsible for election administration, are not receiving the robust funding necessary to keep up with rising costs associated with elections. Worse, these deficits are exacerbated by constant changes to voting laws, recent cybersecurity threats and growing threats of violence. The good news is that looking at recent data, counties that spend more on election administration have been able to boost turnout compared with their neighbors that have spent less to make the ballot accessible.

To support the functioning of our democracy, it is critical that advocates and policymakers focus on the role that funding plays to ensure access to the ballot box and maintain the safety of elections. This BTC report provides an overview of the literature on election funding, analyzes North Carolina’s investment in election administration, and outlines the process and priorities for funding decisions.

NC counties that spend more on election administration boost their residents’ electoral power
Written by Tyler Daye, Common Cause NC
Greater elections funding is associated with higher voter turnout in North Carolina. When comparing county level election spending per voter with 2022 voter turnout statistics from the North Carolina State Board of Elections, Figure 1 shows on average that the more a county spent on elections per voter for the 22-23 fiscal year, the greater the likelihood that county had a higher voter turnout in 2022. More concretely, every $10 in additional funding per person is associated with a 3.4 percentage point increase.
Onslow County provides one of the most striking examples. Among the 83 counties that provided FY 2022-23 budget data, Onslow spent the least amount per voter, $11.98 less than the national average. Onslow County also had the worst voter turnout in the state. Only 37.25% of eligible residents in Onslow County voted in the 2022 general elections. This was well below the statewide turnout of about 51%.
The evidence clearly shows that counties with better funding are boosting the electoral voices of their residents.

 
Funding delivers the right to vote
Voting doesn’t happen by magic. It takes time, expertise, and infrastructure to deliver the franchise. Inadequate funding can block citizens from making their voices heard at the ballot box, perpetuate systemic exclusion from the vote for people of color, and undermine trust in representative democracy.

Funding smooths the path to voting in a host of ways, both during and between election cycles. Protecting the health and safety of voters and poll workers, avoiding long wait times and lines at polling places, streamlining the time-intensive and technology-dependent process of registering voters, and accurately counting votes are all goals that require sustained and adequate funding. Moreover, public funding can provide continuity to election administration by retaining skilled staff, maintaining operational and technological systems for elections, and providing for more comprehensive voter education and outreach strategies.1 As one researcher noted in a study of long voting lines during the 2004 presidential election: “Administering elections requires ample resources. Administering them well requires even more.”2

Underfunded elections reinforce the power and influence of white voters
The strongest predictors of voter participation are the number of polling locations and the hours they are open.3 Researchers have found evidence that variations in election funding by jurisdiction can reinforce racial inequities in the delivery of voting rights in the South.4 Polling place consolidations driven by decreasing budgets have led to Black voters having to wait two times longer than white voters to cast their ballots.5 Researchers have also found that voting infrastructure and processes have more challenges in Black communities and communities with low incomes.6

Adequate public funding can disrupt these inequities and ensure that the ballot box is accessible to all.7

Funding builds trust in the outcomes of elections
The importance of a well-funded, well-functioning election administration goes beyond the quality of the experience for individual voters. Well-funded election administration can advance confidence in our democracy and pathways to broader civic participation. Nationally, the funding of poll workers in particular can matter for confidence in election outcomes.8 Internationally, research into the relationship between election funding and the health of a democracy has found associations between smaller elections budgets and lower voter turnout but also with high levels of election manipulation, voting irregularities, and public dissatisfaction with political parties, legislatures, and governments.9

Public dollars can fund accessible and effective elections
As we seek to strengthen our multi-racial democracy, robust and consistent funding is a critical tool. Consistent funding allows election officials to efficiently plan in advance to ensure that elections run smoothly and ensure voter access is expanded not reduced. Robust funding can adequately support the full range of needs and changing nature of the inputs to a safe and sound election, including modern technology and public health and safety measures. In states like North Carolina where election laws change nearly annually, funding is even more necessary to implement new rules and educate voters about what they need to do to access the ballot.

Efforts to quantify the cost of an election per voter in 2000 estimated the cost at $10 per voter, which when adjusted for inflation requires $17.82 per voter today with high inflation continuing to drive up costs.10  Meanwhile, researchers working to capture the cost during the pandemic estimated roughly $5 billion to administer the national election, an amount that translates to $29.70/ voter.11 Importantly, these measures do not estimate what is needed to get to a fully accessible, adequately funded election, but they do provide a benchmark based on what states across the nation have spent.

Specific costs to administer elections contribute to two important goals for our democracy: an accessible, equitable electoral process and a credible, fair electoral outcome. Recommended funding levels to protect the fundamental right to vote have been determined based on past experiences or estimates of the costs of goods or services that are required for a given voter population or voting process. Costs can vary by more than the size of a voting population in a jurisdiction but also by the format and tools used at a given polling location or by the particular needs of voters (see Figure 2).

Sustained funding is needed even outside of election seasons
These costs represent the most visible aspects of election administration — the experience of voters and the community during the elections themselves. Yet there remain additional aspects of election administration in the lead-up to and follow-up from elections that require funding.

Facility rentals, office supplies, and storage of voting equipment and supplies are year-round expenses for election administration.17

Staffing and training of election administration officials is critical to the planning, monitoring and evaluation of elections. Staff costs include salary and benefits as well as training to remain up to date on the latest systems and election law, and any travel reimbursement or allowances. Election Director roles have widely varying starting salaries from a low of $30,000 to a high of $126,000. In North Carolina, 37 counties had starting salaries below the Living Income Standard for that county.18 The average salary paid to Election Directors in 2021 was $66,000.

Finally, emerging costs have been identified, including $300 million nationwide to keep poll workers safe given threats of violence.19 An additional $316 million is estimated to be needed nationally for securing election processes from internal security threats.20

Taken together, these estimates of the costs to administer elections provide a baseline to assess if public funding protects the voter comprehensively.

 
Figure 3: funding streams for election administration

 
The complicated web of election funding in North Carolina
Election funding can be hard to unpack given the combination of federal, state, and local funding streams, many with specific limitations or purposes. Challenges in gathering comparable data across jurisdictions further complicate research on the true cost of ensuring access to the ballot.21 Budget documents can be difficult to access by the general public and when available are often presented in ways that are difficult to understand for the general public or don’t provide the level of detail that allows for full analysis.

Election administration is funded primarily at the local level by each county, with state and federal funding often providing limited, restricted, or inconsistent funding.

Inconsistent federal funding streams
Federal funds were first authorized by Congress for election administration after the 2000 elections. Subsequently, Congress established funding streams through grants to states and localities in the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2002 with the primary grant programs “(1) making certain general improvements to election administration, (2) replacing lever and punch card voting systems, and (3) meeting the new requirements established by the act.”22

HAVA funds originally required states to maintain the spending effort made in FY1999-2000 and continue to require a state match of 20 percent of the federal amount that the state is seeking to draw down for specific purposes. HAVA funds are not provided to the states every year. From 2010 to 2018, no new funds were made available by Congress to the states.

Once federal funds are provided to North Carolina, these dollars are held in a special fund and must be appropriated for use by the NC General Assembly in a given budget cycle. Due to the unpredictability of federal funding flows, federal funding has been spent over a longer time period than the fiscal year in which the funds arrived to ensure the sustainability of investments and to plan for purchases, such as voting machines, which are funded.23

Over time, additional grant programs have been established under HAVA, including ensuring access to polling places for people with disabilities, providing information about voting to young voters, recruiting poll workers, and improving access to the ballot for people living overseas.24

Although numerous proposals to establish new federal funding streams have been introduced, few have been successfully approved — except during the COVID-19 pandemic. CARES Act funds were provided to states to support the presidential election by funding enhanced public safety measures, expanded mail-in and absentee voting options, and increased staffing.25

One additional federal funding source for election administration will come from a new requirement that 3 percent of the $2 billion in preparedness grants provided to localities by the US Department of Homeland Security must be spent on election security.26 Election security practices identified include: “tamper-evident seals, security cameras, system testing before and after elections, audits, and physical and cybersecurity access controls.”27 This allocation of funding affirms a decision in 2017 by the US Department of Homeland Security that determined elections are critical infrastructure.

State funding for administration of elections is limited
State appropriations from the General Fund generally have been limited to the state’s funding of the Board of Elections’ staffing and operations that oversee elections as well as those that monitor campaign reporting and campaign finance ethics. These critical state functions that support elections in every county of North Carolina include maintaining voter files, tracking voter registration, and certifying election results.

Although the State Board of Elections is not required to fund localities for election operations, from time to time, state dollars are appropriated to be provided to counties. One instance in which General Fund revenue was provided to support counties directly was in 2008 when $1 million was allocated to fund the expansion of early voting sites.28 Another instance occurred in 2001 when state budget writers provided funds to support one-stop absentee voting sites in select counties.29

The State Board of Elections often administers funding that passes through to local jurisdictions and at times has the discretion to set the formulas that determine how funds will be allocated statewide. For example, the State Board of Elections allocated CARES Act funding in 2020 by using factors such as the size of the voting population and the measure of economic distress in the county.30 In so doing, the state Board of Elections recognized its opportunity to ensure that whether a county has its own resources to adequately fund elections should not determine voters’ experience at the polls.

Local election funding constrained by local capacity
Local Boards of Elections are primarily responsible for all aspects of election administration in North Carolina. To fund this year-round work that can be punctuated by multiple time-limited election events, Local Boards of Elections receive funding from the county Board of Commissioners as part of the annual budget process (see Figure 4. Election Funding Calendar). Local funding for elections often depends on the broader fiscal context in the community — its capacity to raise revenue and the impacts of broader economic trends like recessions — as well as the broader needs that must be met by a local budget.31 In North Carolina, decreased state funding to support public services has put pressure on local budgets serving to further hold down spending levels across many critical areas, including election administration.32

Philanthropic funding streams helped meet costs of election
Funding from philanthropic organizations to support smooth elections in 2020 were a stopgap measure necessitated by the costs brought on by the pandemic and the lack of political will to provide adequate public funding.

This emergency funding provided much-needed poll worker capacity, protective masks, and even single-use pens, all key investments in keeping voters safe and elections secure. During the pandemic, 97 of 100 NC counties accepted philanthropic investment to make elections run smoothly in rural and urban counties, small and large.

Despite the importance of these dollars in meeting rising costs, legislatures nationwide and in North Carolina have sought to ban the funding of elections with private funds33 without addressing the underlying problem of chronic underfunding.

The latest push in North Carolina has come in the form of a policy provision in the NC House budget proposal.  The proposal would ban the use of private funding sources by State and County Boards of Elections going forward.

As the Center for Tech and Civic Life noted in its final report on the COVID-19 Response Grants that provided more than $300 million to jurisdictions across the country:

“CTCL believes that election administration should be fully funded by federal, state, and local governments across the country, and the quality of election administration each voter receives should not depend on the tax base or size of their county.

“Philanthropy helped alleviate an emergency in 2020, and in ‘normal years’ it can help election offices build capacity, streamline processes, and make capital investments. But philanthropy is no substitute for predictable government funding.”34

When state and local funding decisions are made
Voters and advocates need to understand when funding decisions that will shape their ability to make their voices heard at the ballot box are being made. Local election administration funding is part of the annual local budget process initiated by the county manager and decided by the county Board of Commissioners with input from the local Board of Elections and staff. The County Manager engages the Board of Elections in the fall to begin to identify budgetary needs. The local budget must be approved by the end of the fiscal year or June 30. Each new fiscal year begins July 1. While the process varies by local jurisdiction, the calendar for local budget development and passage follows a similar timeline as outlined in Figure 4.

There are several opportunities for public engagement and for decisions to be made about the final budget, such as the number, location, and hours of operation for early voting sites and the pay for election administrators as well as poll workers.

Public engagement in the budget process has the potential to make funding more adequate given evidence that constituencies sharing their priority for a public service have often resulted in securing funding asks.35

State and county funding falls short of the need
It is widely recognized that funding for election administration is often a low priority or overlooked in spending conversations and that funding levels fall far significantly short of the scale of need.36 At the state level, funding levels for election administration are falling behind the rising cost of goods and services and growth in the voting population. At the local level, funding remains noticeably low. In combination, these trends raise serious concerns that adequate funding is out of reach in order to protect North Carolina’s free and fair elections and to give voters confidence that their votes are properly counted.

 
Figure 5

There are two available ways to look at the funding of election administration at the state level.

One measure looks at the state’s effort to maintain election spending as required in the early years of the federal Help America Vote Act. North Carolina’s state dollars going to elections had to at least meet the threshold of $3.4 million based on the state funding levels for HAVA-covered activities in place during Fiscal Year 1999-2000. This maintenance of effort amount provides a bare minimum baseline for funding certain election administration activities — particularly related to voting systems — even though the US Election Assistance Commission has most recently determined that maintenance of effort is no longer required by law.

When current spending is looked at against this baseline, it shows that North Carolina’s funding effort has declined by 21 percent when adjusted for the cost of delivering these government services even as the agencies’ help-desk tickets have increased threefold just in the past decade. Again, while technically not in violation of federal law to fall short of this baseline, the goal to add to and not diminish the total funding commitment to elections has not been met.37

Another way to look at funding for election administration is to look at the state appropriation relative to the size of the voting population. As of early 2023, there are 7.3 million people registered to vote in North Carolina. As the number of registered voters in our state has increased, funding to the State Board of Elections has decreased when adjusted for the increased cost of delivering government services. The NC State Board of Elections budget for election administration, not including campaign finance and ethics reporting, has decreased by 19 percent between the 2007 and 2023 fiscal years; meanwhile, the number of registered voters in North Carolina has increased by 33 percent during the same period (see Figure 5).

In addition to singular measures, the most recent annual budget requests to the NC General Assembly and to Congress point to identified priorities that are going unmet under current state spending plans. In both instances, the need to adequately staff operations in technology and support services to County Boards of Elections were identified as critical needs given the volume of support requests and the broader context of threats. In addition, a specific, significant request for $13 million to support the upgrade of technology that all counties rely on for election administration was identified in the State Board of Elections’ request to the NC General Assembly for Fiscal Year 2023-2024.38

Ongoing research will be necessary to fully assess the level of funding needed at the state level to provide the backbone of support to election administration statewide at a truly adequate level to the goal of an accessible ballot box for all eligible voters. In the meantime, the measures assessed here demonstrate that the state is not keeping up with key levels and areas of funding that prioritize access to the ballot box in complement to the heavy emphasis on election security from federal funding streams.

County funding for election administration is less than a penny of every $1 spent.39

North Carolina requires local governments — and specifically counties — to fund election administration. Election administration funding across North Carolina’s counties has averaged less than 1 percent of county budgets over the past three elections. In the most recent budgets for the Fiscal Year 2022-23, Stokes County made the highest funding commitment as a share of the county budget, and Onslow County made the lowest.

As noted above, researchers’ most comprehensive review of election administration costs in 2000 found that administering an election averaged the equivalent of $17.82 per voter nationwide when adjusted for inflation. At a minimum, North Carolina counties should be reaching the national average in funding effort. Given the documented costs for funding elections during the pandemic, it is the bare minimum that our democracy can afford.

Analysis of the Fiscal Year 2022-23 county budgets available (Figure 6) shows that 18 counties met the recommended funding level and 64 fell short. Twenty counties did not have budget data available for their Board of Elections.

 
Figure 6


Photo IDs raise costs for voters and election administrators
Photo identification as a requirement to vote — as is being reheard in the state Supreme Court — would raise the costs for election administrators as well as voters.

When the photo voter ID proposal was being considered in 2018, various election administration costs associated with the implementation of strict voter identification laws included but were not limited to producing voter identification cards, conducting voter education and public outreach, revising and providing additional election materials, and training poll workers, as well as expanding staffing for election administration, IT infrastructure, and the processing of identification.40

To implement a previous law requiring photo identification (H589) in North Carolina, the State Board of Elections spent upward of $3 million on voter outreach staff, printed materials for polling places and training, a paid media campaign, and related expenses.41 County election boards spent millions more, including printing their own materials and placing additional staff at each of the 3,000-plus Election Day and early voting polling sites to facilitate the administration of the law when it was in effect for the March 2016 primary. A fiscal note from the state’s Fiscal Research Division prior to the law’s passage estimated that the cost of staffing, printing, and otherwise delivering the creation of a “free” photo identification card would cost between $4.17 to $6.54 per registered voter who was without identification.42

Even as the costs would rise for the state and counties should this requirement be implemented, the costs would rise too for individual North Carolinians, creating financial barriers in the form of fees for identification, travel costs, and lost time.

Conclusion
A budget is a reflection of our priorities as a community. The underfunding of election administration raises serious concerns about the commitment of our budget writers to delivering fair and free elections as the foundation of our democracy. Funding increases, particularly in the area of funding access to the ballot box, will be needed to uphold our democracy and the confidence that every vote will be counted and that every voice will be heard.
