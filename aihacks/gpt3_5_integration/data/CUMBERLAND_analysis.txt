⚠️ Medium Risk

* ⚠️ High:  Poll worker intimidation, documented in findings, directly suppresses voting.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Features `voted_2020_w`, `voted_2020`, suggest targeting repeat voters.
* ⚠️ Medium: `race_UNDESIGNATED` and `race_BLACK` hint at potential racial targeting.
* ⚠️ Medium: Low pay for election directors correlates with less experience and higher incident reports.
* ✅ Low:  Partisan poll observer increase, while concerning, lacks direct suppression evidence.
