⚠️ Medium Risk

* ⚠️ High: Poll worker intimidation (factual finding) suggests suppression attempts.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Features like `voted_2020` and `voter_party_code_DEM` may indicate targeting.
* ⚠️ Medium: Low pay for election directors (factual finding) correlates with less experience and potential administrative neglect.
* ✅ Low: Features `race_BLACK` and `race_UNDESIGNATED` show minor impact, needing further investigation.
