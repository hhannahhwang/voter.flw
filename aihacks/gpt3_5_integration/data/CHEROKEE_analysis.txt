✅ Low Risk

* ⚠️ Medium:  Past poll worker intimidation warrants monitoring, but the model's low weighting suggests limited impact.
* ✅ Low:  Voter history features (voted_2020, voted_2016) show minimal suppression; participation is not overtly targeted.
* ✅ Low:  Party affiliation (DEM/REP) and demographics (age, gender, race) have weak influences, implying no clear targeting.
* ✅ Low:  Underfunded election offices correlate with lower turnout, but the overall risk score remains low.  Further investigation is needed.
