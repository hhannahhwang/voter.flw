⚠️ Medium Risk

* ⚠️ High:  Poll worker intimidation risks suppressing votes, especially given reported targeting of minority groups.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Past voting behavior is a strong predictor, suggesting potential disenfranchisement of infrequent voters.
* ⚠️ Medium: Underfunded election administration correlates with lower turnout, disproportionately impacting certain communities.
* ✅ Low: While age and race appear as features, the impact is minor relative to other factors.
