⚠️ Medium Risk

* ⚠️ Medium — High 2020 voter turnout suggests potential targeting of newly registered or infrequent voters.
* ⚠️ High — Poll worker intimidation, documented in factual findings, directly suppresses participation.
* ⚠️ Medium —  Disproportionate focus on Democratic voters hints at partisan suppression efforts.
* ⚠️ Medium — Underfunded election administration correlates with reduced turnout, particularly affecting marginalized communities.
* ✅ Low — While age is a factor, its low weighting suggests limited suppression impact.
