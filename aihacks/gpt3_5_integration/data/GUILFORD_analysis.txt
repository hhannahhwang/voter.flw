⚠️ Medium Risk

* ⚠️ High:  Aggressive poll watching, potentially targeting minority voters.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Underpaid election directors lead to inexperienced staff & higher incident rates.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Racial gerrymandering allegations suppress Black voter influence.
* ⚠️ Medium: Underfunded counties show less voter turnout due to administrative issues.
* ✅ Low: Age and past voting history are not evidence of suppression.
