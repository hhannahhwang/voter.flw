⚠️ Medium Risk

* ⚠️ High:  Poll worker intimidation, potentially suppressing minority votes.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Low pay for election officials correlates with higher turnover and less experience.
* ⚠️ Medium: Targeting of specific demographics (race and party) in model features suggests potential bias.
* ✅ Low:  While age is a feature, there's no evidence of age-based suppression.
