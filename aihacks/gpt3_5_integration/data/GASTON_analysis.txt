⚠️ Medium Risk

* ⚠️ High:  Aggressive poll watching training raises intimidation concerns, potentially suppressing minority votes.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Underpaid election directors correlate with increased incidents and less experienced staff.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Racial gerrymandering allegations suggest systematic efforts to dilute Black voting power.
* ✅ Low:  Voter history features weakly correlate with suppression, impacting all voters similarly.
