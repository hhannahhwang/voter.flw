⚠️ Medium Risk

* ⚠️ High:  High prominence of recent voter turnout and past voting history features suggests potential targeting of specific demographics.
* ⚠️ Medium:  "Undesignated race" feature highlights potential administrative issues hindering participation for certain groups.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Overly aggressive poll watchers, especially targeting minority groups, indicate a suppression risk.
* ✅ Low: Age as a feature is not inherently indicative of suppression, requiring further investigation.
