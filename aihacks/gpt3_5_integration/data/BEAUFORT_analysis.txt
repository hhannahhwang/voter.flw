* ⚠️ High:  Poll worker intimidation poses a significant threat to fair elections.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Past voting behavior is a predictor, suggesting suppression efforts.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Underpaid election directors correlate with higher incident reports.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Racial targeting is suggested by feature importance and gerrymandering.
* ✅ Low: Age as a feature is unlikely to be a primary suppression factor alone.
