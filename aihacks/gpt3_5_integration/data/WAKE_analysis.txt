⚠️ Medium Risk

* ⚠️ High:  Poll worker intimidation (factual finding) suggests suppression attempts.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Features highlighting past voting behavior may disenfranchise infrequent voters.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Underfunded election administration (factual finding) disproportionately impacts certain groups.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Racial targeting indicated by model features and gerrymandering allegations.
* ✅ Low:  Age as a feature may reflect lifecycle voting patterns, not suppression.
