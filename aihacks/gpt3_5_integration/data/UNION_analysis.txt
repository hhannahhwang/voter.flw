⚠️ Medium Risk

* ⚠️ High:  Poll worker intimidation (factual finding) suggests suppression attempts.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Emphasis on past voting (voted_2020_w, voted_2020) may disenfranchise infrequent voters.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Low pay for election directors (factual finding) correlates with decreased turnout.
* ✅ Low:  While racial targeting features (race_UNDESIGNATED, race_BLACK) appear, evidence is weak.
