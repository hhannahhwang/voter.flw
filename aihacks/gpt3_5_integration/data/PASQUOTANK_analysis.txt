⚠️ Medium Risk

* ⚠️ High:  Poll worker intimidation directly impacts election integrity, suppressing participation.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Voter history features suggest targeting repeat voters, possibly suppressing specific groups.
* ⚠️ Medium:  Undesignated race codes hinder accurate demographic analysis, masking potential bias.
* ⚠️ Medium: Low pay for election officials correlates with less experience, potentially leading to errors or mismanagement.
* ✅ Low: Age as a factor alone is not indicative of targeted suppression.
